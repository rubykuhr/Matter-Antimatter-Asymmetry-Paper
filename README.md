# Matter-Antimatter-Asymmetry-Paper
Written during my 3rd year of university. This paper received a 1st (at a mark of 74.5)
This paper discusses the analysis I performed to quantify the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the charmless B meson decay to 3 pions from a set of data collected at the LHCb experiment in 2012.
